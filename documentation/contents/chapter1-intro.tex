\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:1}

Most previous visualizations of graph algorithms \cite{storz2013idp,velden2014idp,sefidgar2015idp,becker2015idp,zoennchen2015idp,fischer2016idp,feil2016idp} are based on displaying the state of the algorithm on top of a network visualization of a graph, e.g. by annotating vertices or edges with additional information.

For advanced graph algorithms, which are often employed for efficiency reasons, the state size to visualize may become quite large. It may be thus advantageous to visualize the state of such algorithms in an additional visualization layer. 

The ideas of these visualizations have long existed in a static form in textbooks describing the theory behind these algorithms with specific examples. Nevertheless, we are unaware of a dynamic visualization of these additional state variables.
