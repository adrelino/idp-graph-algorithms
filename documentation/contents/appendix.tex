\chapter{Appendix}\label{ch:appendix}

In the appendix you can include \eg computer codes or further remarks which would disturb the flow of the main text. If you do not need an appendix, you can simply leave out this file (in which case you should also delete the \verb|\include| command in \texttt{thesis.tex}).
