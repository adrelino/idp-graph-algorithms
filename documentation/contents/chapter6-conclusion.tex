\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:6}
We developed two interactive web applications for advanced graph algorithms that can be accessed freely and furthermore made the source code available as open source to ease further extensions. We motivated the need for a secondary visualization layer concept and implemented it.

New technologies such as D3.js and SVG have been introduced as well as a lot of smaller new features implemented that make using the web application more interactive.

Over the years, a lot of web applications have been developed independently by different students. A lot of code was copied and partially modified, which resulted in a huge amount of duplication. The duplication of JavaScript files was minimized through the improved software design of this project, an early version of which \cite{feil2016idp} already applied to migrate previous, Canvas based implementations \cite{storz2013idp,velden2014idp,sefidgar2015idp,becker2015idp} to SVG.
