<div><h1>Visualization of advanced graph algorithms</h1>
	<div>This IDP aims at extending the previous HTML5 framework that was developed at the chair to support advanced graph algorithms:</div><div><ul><li>the Tarjan-Goldberg push-relabel algorithm to solve the <b>maximum flow problem</b><br></li><li>a Label Setting algorithm to solve the shortest path problem with resource constraints (<b>SPPRC</b>)</li></ul></div><div>In particular, the goal was to provide an intuitive visual representation of all state variables and state transitions during the algorithm execution. Since both algorithms carry a lot of state information, an additional visualization layer, linked to the original graph layer was developed. This second layer displays:</div><div><ul><li>the <b>height function</b> of each node in case of the Tarjan-Goldberg algorithm</li><li>the <b>pareto frontier</b> of all labels resident in a certain node in case of the Label Setting algorithm<br></li></ul><div>To achieve the goal of a highly interactive and easily extensible user experience, we replaced the old canvas based graph visualization code, which was really hard to extend, with a new implementation using the Stanford development&nbsp;<b>D3.js</b> (or just <b>D3</b> for <b>Data-Driven Documents</b>), a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. It makes use of the widely implemented SVG, HTML5, and CSS standards.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>During the development process, we also migrated the existing<b>&nbsp;graph editor</b>&nbsp;to the new technologies, it now easily supports</div><div><ul><li>an arbitrary number of resources defined on edges and nodes</li><li>download and upload functionality</li><li>cropped SVG export of graphs<br></li></ul><div>This talk is not only suitable to mathematicians found of graph problems, but to anyone who wants to leverage today's web standards to express his interactive visualization needs.</div>
